## 🐍 Python Data Structures – Practice Tasks

This repository includes **two Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** files:
 *Task 1* and *Task 2* containing beginner-level Python exercises focused on **Data Structures**.

 ### 📂 Files included
 - [Task 1](Code/Data%20Structures%20Practice_1.ipynb)  
- [Task 2](Code/Data%20Structures%20Practice_2.ipynb) 
 
--- 

 Each notebook includes examples and exercises about:
- **Basic data types:** integers, floats, strings, booleans  
- **Data structures:** lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  

---

### 🚀 Purpose
These notebooks were created and practiced in **Google Colab** as part of my **DataCube BootCamp-Python course**.  
The goal is to:
- Strengthen understanding of Python Data Structures  
- Practice core methods and operations in a simple, practical way  
- Build a solid foundation for future data analysis and programming work
